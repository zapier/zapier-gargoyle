Gargoyle is a platform built on top of Django which allows you to switch functionality of your application on and off
based on conditions.

It was originally created by `Disqus <https://github.com/disqus/gargoyle>`_, but due to the inactivity we at YPlan have
taken over maintenance on this fork.

Requirements
------------

Tested with all combinations of:

* Python: 2.7, 3.4, 3.5
* Django: 1.8, 1.9

Install
-------

Install it with **pip**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gargoyle-yplan

If you are upgrading from the original to this fork, you will need to run the following first, since the packages clash:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall django-modeldict gargoyle

Failing to do this will mean that ``pip uninstall gargoyle`` will also erase the files for ``gargoyle-yplan``, and
similarly for our ``django-modeldict`` fork.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available at `Read The Docs <http://gargoyle-yplan.readthedocs.org/>`_.
