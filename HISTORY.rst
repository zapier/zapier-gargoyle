Pending Release
---------------

* New release notes here
* Added missing argument message and documents for management commands

1.2.7 (2016-12-01)
------------------

* Added three built-in condition sets for checking if today is before or after
  a date - ``UTCTodayConditionSet``, ``AppTodayConditionSet``, and
  ``ActiveTimezoneTodayConditionSet``.

1.2.6 (2016-08-03)
------------------

* Set requirements to exclude ``django-jsonfield==1.0.0`` which is broken for
  PostgreSQL - use ``1.0.1+`` instead.
* Made ``gargoyle.register()`` usable as a decorator
* Made ``gargoyle.unregister()`` return the boolean value of whether something
  was unregistered.
* Fixed removing conditions where the value is the empty string.

1.2.5 (2016-05-09)
------------------

* Removed debug prints from ``conditions.py`` which spammed your WSGI logs.

1.2.4 (2016-05-02)
------------------

* Added a migration to tidy up ``bytes`` versus ``str`` for ``choices`` on
  ``Switch.status``. It's no-op as ``choices`` is in-memory only.

1.2.3 (2016-04-11)
------------------

* Bugfix for ``@switches`` which didn't work on ``TestCase`` classes properly
  in 1.2.2.

1.2.2 (2016-04-11)
------------------

* Removed the South Migrations, since South doesn't support Django 1.7+, and
  Gargoyle only supports Django 1.8+.
* Added all ``__future__`` imports to all files for Python 2.7/3
  compatibility.
* Made ``@switches`` usable as a class decorator for ``unittest.TestCase``
  classes as well, where it applies from ``setUpClass`` through all tests to
  ``tearDownClass``. This adds a dependency on ``contextdecorator`` on Python
  2.7.

1.2.1 (2016-02-25)
------------------

* Simplified autodiscovery code to use ``AppConfig.ready()``. It's no longer
  necessary to add a call to ``gargoyle.autodiscover()`` in your ``urls.py``,
  when not using Nexus.
* Fixed url ``patterns`` warnings that appear on Django 1.9

1.2.0 (2016-02-12)
------------------

* Fixed the splitting of ``Range`` conditions, a merge of disqus/gargoyle#55,
  thanks @matclayton.
* Fixed the parsing of ``Range`` conditions for the Nexus admin interface.
* Fixed the Nexus interface to work with Switches that contain dots in their
  names, a merge of disqus/gargoyle#73, thanks @Raekkeri.
* Removed all inline javascript.
* Added ``ifnotswitch`` template tag, a merge of disqus/gargoyle#92, thanks
  @mrfuxi.
* Fixed Nexus admin interface for Switches with spaces in their keys, an issue
  reported in disqus/gargoyle#98, thanks @arnaudlimbourg.
